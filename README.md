# DayZ Server Manager

A cross-platform Electron desktop application for managing DayZ dedicated servers with SteamCMD integration, workshop mod management, server file updates, config editing, and log viewing.

- **Server Management**: Download, update, and validate DayZ server files
- **Workshop Mods**: Search, download, and update mods by name or ID
- **Config Editor**: Edit server configuration files with syntax highlighting
- **Log Viewer**: View historical and real-time server logs
- **Clean UI**: Modern, dark-themed interface

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+

## Disclaimer

This project will be maintained by myself and AI, some of this project is out of my knowledge depth.
The entire program should be in a working state always, if not open an issue.
